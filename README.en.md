## How to contibute

The posts are available following the standard hugo hierarchy, so look in [`/content`](https://github.com/paris-ci/Arthur_Knowledgebase_Source/tree/master/content), and choose your type of article.

### Translate a post

To translate a post, copy/paste the french version (`[NAME].md` - to translate to english), or the english version (`[NAME].en.md` - to translate to french), use the correct name for the language you are translating to (french goes into `[NAME].md`, english into `[NAME].en.md`) and then you just have to translate the sentences inside inside. Try to keep variables names found in form definition.

Feel free to send a PR to correct orthographic or syntaxic typos, change the way something is said, or add some complements!

### Upgrade an existing article

Just modify the article file (do a search by name), and make up a PR with your changes, upgrades or supplementary information, that'll make me happy!

### Add an article

If you aren't sure if the post will fit, just open up an issue, then redact your article (don't forget to change the date in the template, examples in the [`/archetypes` folder](https://github.com/paris-ci/Arthur_Knowledgebase_Source/tree/master/archetypes)), or just use [hugo if it's installed on your computer already](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-1-install-hugo) : `hugo new article/[NAME].md`)

Feel free to use other posts for examples, importantly on the 'personalize the article' form.
